 * System Agent - Simple FW Monitor that can notify host drivers in the event
 * of any FW errors. The SA assumes that each core will enter the idle state
 * from time to time (within a period of PLATFORM_IDLE_TIME). If the core does
 * not enter the idle loop through looping forever or scheduling some work
 * continuously then the SA will emit trace and panic().
